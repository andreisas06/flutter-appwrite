# Appwrite clean

## Architecture

This App is generated using the `base_app` brick provided by [Baseflow](https://baseflow.com). The app is structured to follow the [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) principles created by Robert C. Martin.

This means the app is split up into multiple folders listed in the `packages` folder. The template generates the following packages by default:

- **appwrite_clean**: Bootstrap project responsible for wiring up all packages in the right order.
- **ui**: Project representing the presentation layer. This is where all pages, widgets and BLoC classes should go.
- **core**: Project representing the business logic layer. This is where all use cases, domain classes and repository contracts are defined.
- **data**: Project representing the data layer. This is where the repository contracts are implemented, DTO's are set up, etc.

More details on the Baseflow architecture for Flutter applications can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QvjxjiNc1MCb_Yn36xcXJxAzSYwhNMk5oslSacRqI3A/edit?usp=sharing).

## Running the app

By default the app contains 3 run configurations: `development`, `staging`, `production`. These are pre-configured to run from IntelliJ IDEA / Android Studio and Visual Studio Code.

### 1. Get the dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Run the generators
As we use code generation in the whole project you must run this command to regenerate all the generated code:
```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### 3. Environment variables
The environment are already setup, you can find them in the `.env.dev`, `.env.stag` and `.env.prod` file.
You can your own environment for local development for example. Simply make a copy of the `.env.dev` file and rename it to `.env.dev_local`. Make changes accordingly.

To specify what environment file is used, run the app with the `--dart-define=ENV_FILE=.env.dev` flag. 

```bash
> :warning: **Never commit secrets**: The `.env.dev`, `.env.stag` and `.env.prod` files are checked in so we can all use the same environment variables. If you add a new environment file, make sure to NOT add any secrets to it.
```

### 4. Run the app
Now you should be able to run the app from your IDE.

If you want to run the app from command line use:
```bash
flutter run
```
With custom web-port:
```bash
flutter run --web-port=8080
```
With custom target:
```bash
flutter run --target lib/main.dart
```
If you want to specify the environment file:
```bash
flutter run --dart-define=ENV_FILE=.env.dev
```
If you don't specify the environment file, the app will default to the `.env.dev` file.

## Creating a new release build

Android: `flutter build apk --flavor production --dart-define-from-file config.prod.json`
iOS: `flutter build ipa --flavor production --dart-define-from-file config.prod.json`

## Deploying the app

- Merging PR's into the develop branch will deploy to the test environment.
- Merging into the staging branch will deploy the app to the staging environment.
- Merging into the main branch will deploy the app to the production environment.

## TODO-list regarding general project setup

### Splash Screen

- Replace the `assets/splash.png` with the desired project splash screen. Make sure this image is sufficiently large!
- Run `dart run flutter_native_splash:create`

Configuration for the splash screen can be found in the root under `flutter_native_splash.yaml`.
For additional project specific configuration options see the [flutter_native_splash](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_native_splash) package.

### Launcher Icons

- Replace the `assets/launcher_icons/` folder contents with the launcher icons for the project.
- Run `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons -f flutter_launcher_icons.yaml`. 

Configuration for the launcher icons can be found in the root under `flutter_launcher_icons.yaml`.
For additional project specific configuration options see the [flutter_launcher_icons](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons) package.

### Enable Crashlytics

To enable Crashlytics in your project, checkout [Get started with Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/get-started?platform=flutter)

The code from Step 2 is already in `lib/main.dart` and commented out. Once you have setup Firebase you can uncomment the following code:
```dart
// await Firebase.initializeApp();
```
```dart
// FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.recordFlutterFatalError(errorDetails);
```
```dart
// // Pass all uncaught asynchronous errors that aren't handled by the Flutter framework to Crashlytics
// PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError = (error, stack) {
//   FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.recordError(error, stack, fatal: true);
//   return true;
// };
```

### Environment config

There are 3 configs available by default: `config.dev.json`, `config.staging.json`, `config.prod.json`

```json
    "BASE_URL": "https://randomuser.me/api/",
    "AUTH_URL": "https://example.com/auth",
    "DEFAULT_USERNAME": "user",
    "DEFAULT_PASSWORD": "password"
```

You need to add the base url and auth endpoint to connect api's. When you fill the default username and password they will be set in debug mode.

### Navigation and routing

The RootNavigator contains a StatefulShellRoute which will be used as root for navigation patterns like BottomNavigation. The RootScaffold picks up these routes and uses them for the navigation pattern that is implemented on the platform and screen sizes.

To add pages to the navigation add a `StatefulShellBranch` to the `StatefulShellRoute`.

### Adding additional targets

When you want to add new targets to the project like MacOS or Linux you can run the following command in the root folder of your app:

`flutter create . --project-name $projectname --org $organization --platforms android,ios,web,windows,macos,linux --no-overwrite`

Replace `$projectname` and `$organization` with your own and only use the platforms you want to add.

## TODO Android Release

The steps below are required to prepare the Android application for release and ensure the continuous delivery scripts work successfully. The commands used in these steps assume you are running on a Linux or macOS machine. If you are on Windows these commands might be slightly different. 

Part of these steps use GnuPG (binary name `gpg`) to encrypt sensitive information. GnuPG is pre-installed on most Linux distributions, however not on macOS. Installing GnuPG on macOS is done using one of the package managers:

- [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/): `brew install gnupg gnupg2`
- [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/): `sudo port install gnupg gnupg2`

- In `./android` run `keytool -genkey -v -keystore ./upload-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload` to generate an upload key.
- Make sure to update `key.properties` with the password. The placeholder values will make release builds fail.
- Do not add key.properties to git.
- Navigate to `./android` and execute `gpg -c --armor key.properties`.
- Save the passphrase to Github Actions' secret `ANDROID_KEY_PASSPHRASE`.
- Navigate to `./android` and execute `gpg -c --armor upload-keystore.jks`.
- Save the passphrase to Github Actions' secret `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSPHRASE`.
- Save the output of `cat key.properties.asc` to `ANDROID_KEY_ASC`.
- Save the output of `cat upload-keystore.jks.asc` to `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_ASC`.
- Save the passphrases used in the Baseflow 1password. That way we don't lose them.
- Save the `key.properties.asc` and `upload-keystore.jks.asc` in Baseflow 1password.
- Create a Google play service-account with the customer.
- Save the Google play service-account JSON as `PLAY_STORE_GSERVICE_ACCOUNT` in the github secrets.
- Run your first Android build using `melos build:android` and manually upload the resulting binary (`./build/app/outputs/bundle/release/appwrite_clean.aab`) to Google Play internal testing.

## TODO iOS Release

The steps below are required to prepare the iOS application for release and ensure the continuous delivery scripts work successfully. The steps below require a macOS machine and won't work on a Linux or Windows machine.

Part of these steps use GnuPG (binary name `gpg`) to encrypt sensitive information. GnuPG is pre-installed on most Linux distributions, however not on macOS. Installing GnuPG on macOS is done using one of the package managers:
- [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/): `brew install gnupg gnupg2`
- [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/): `sudo port install gnupg gnupg2`

- Go to [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/bundleId) and add the identifier `com.baseflow.appwrite-clean`.
- Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps) and add a new app with `com.baseflow.appwrite-clean` as Bundle ID.
- SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) is a value Apple will include in the reports and can be used by the organization to identify the app. Usually the value used is the same as the bundle identifier, but could be anything as long as it is unique within the organization.
- Open KeyChain on you MacOs device. [Follow the steps](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/devbfa00fef7) to create a certificate singing request.
- Go to the [Apple Website](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/add) and select Apple Distribution.
- Upload the Certificate Signing Request file created with Keychain.
- Download the certificate after uploading the request.
- Import the certificate in Keychain.
- Export a .p12 file from the imported certificate. Save the password to Github Actions Secrets `P12_PASSWORD`.
- Save the .p12 file and the password in 1password.
- Visit [Apple Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resource/profiles/add). Select App Store, under Distribution.
- For `App ID` select the app created previously.
- For `Select certificate` select the certificate created previously. And give the profile a name in the next step.
- Download the provisioning profile.
- In your terminal navigate to .p12 file location and execute `gpg -c --armor <name_of_file>.mobileprovision`.
- Save the passphrase to Github Actions' secret `IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_PASSWORD`.
- In your terminal navigate to .cert file location and execute `gpg -c --armor <name_of_file>.p12`.
- Save the passphrase to Github Actions' secret `IOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`.
- Save the output of `cat <name_of_file>.mobileprovision.asc` to `IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_ASC`.
- Save the output of `cat <name_of_file>.p12.asc` to `IOS_CERTIFICATE_ASC`.
- Save all asc outputs and passphrases used in the Baseflow 1password. That way we don't lose them.
- Update `export-options.plist` with the TeamID at `<ENTER TEAM CODE HERE>`.
- Update `export-options.plist` with the name of the provisioning profile at `<ENTER PROVISIONING NAME HERE>`.
- Open the project in XCode and disable automatic code signing in Release flavors and set the provisioning profile to the one imported above.
- This should change `./ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` by adding `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`, `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER`, `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY` and `CODE_SIGN_STYLE`.
- Go to [AppStoreConnect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/api/new) and create a new API key.
- Give the API key a name and set `Access` to `App manager`, any other role will fail the deployments.
- Download the API key, and save the `Issuer ID` and `Key ID`.
- In GitHub create a secret called `APP_STORE_API_PRIVATE_KEY` and save the contents of the downloaded .p8 file there.
- Create two additional secrets `APP_STORE_ISSUER_ID` and `APP_STORE_API_KEY_ID` and save the Issuer ID and Key ID respectively.
